> [Attack Vectors]
> SQL injection is a type of cyber attack that allows an attacker to execute malicious SQL statements against a database. These attacks can have serious consequences, including:
>
> 1. Theft of sensitive data: An attacker can use SQL injection to access and steal confidential data from a database, such as passwords, financial information, or personal information.
> 2. Modification of data: An attacker can use SQL injection to alter or delete data from a database, potentially causing incorrect results or system failures.
> 3. Denial of service: An attacker can use SQL injection to flood a database with requests, causing it to become slow or unresponsive to legitimate requests.
> 4. Server compromise: In some cases, an attacker can use SQL injection to gain unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and take complete control of the server.
