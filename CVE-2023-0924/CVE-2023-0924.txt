> Attack Vectors:
> Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step. The software allows the attacker to upload or transfer files of dangerous types that can be automatically processed within the product's environment.
